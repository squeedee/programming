Learning to program is not computer science. It is not computer engineering.
Learning to program is learning to communicate. You're holding a conversation
with the computer, and *simultaneously* communicating with others.

It's been said, but it's worth repeating. Those "others" need to understand your
intent, and these people are:

* You. In the future. You *will not* remember. Not even tommorow. I'm serious. Take this as an article of faith if you have to.
* Collegues. The people you work with. If they know what you were thinking (without asking you) - that's a huge win!
* Clients. It's unlikely when programming that you will work in a vacuum. You will need to spend time with *someone* and it will
  help you program. Please, collaborate. If you think you're better off alone, I think you're crazy.

This book is centered around Object Oriented design and Agile development practices. These include but are not limited to:
* Short feedback cycles - know how something feels and behaves before you put too much time into design.
* Test Driven Development - TDD drives SOLID design (which this book covers extensively)
* Face to Face communication instead of heavy comments, documentation and specifications.
* Seperation of concerns - reducing complexity by the expedient method of not writing complex componentry.

Object Oriented because that is the current design philosophy du jour.
There are other approaches, philosphies, languages. You can play with all of these,
in fact, it is highly recommended that you do. However, this book sticks with well
covered ground to help you get into software development without conflating approaches.

Most of the demonstrations in this book use the Ruby programming
language. Why? Because the author loves Ruby. More than that, Ruby is expressive, and can
produce concise examples that ease comprehension.

This book has a lofty goal of not only introducing software development, but also setting you
up for success. It covers the core requirements to write *indefinitely maintainable* software.

This book cites other books or online references in place of some content. This author sees no 
reason to repeat or plagiarise content that others have so brilliantly defined.
